# Neighborhood Map Project

My map shows markers along with a list of places that my wife and I have visited recently.  Click on items from
either the list or on the markers in order to see a picture from my trip to the location selected along with a
Wikipedia article about the city.

## Main Objective

The purpose of this project was to use Knockout and Google Maps APIs to create a map that displays information
about various locations using a 3rd party API.  The API I chose to use was Wikipedia so I can pull in information
about each city.  This is one of the final projects for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree.  
Completion of this project relies on both skills already learned from previous projects and new ones introduced that are specific
to this one, such as Knockout and use of APIs.
